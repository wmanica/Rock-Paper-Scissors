## Rock-Paper-Scissors

Ruby on Rails project for a version of the game Rock Paper Scissors aka Rochambeau

## What it does

- The application should allow a user to choose 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'
- The application make a request to a external api to retrieve the serverâ€™s throw.
- If the external does not work, an alternative is generated by this app.
- The application should responds with a JSON response indicating whether the user won, lost or tied

## Game Rules

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock
- Identical throws tie (rock == rock, etc.)
